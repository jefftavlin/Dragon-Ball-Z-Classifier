# Dragon Ball Z Classifier:
- Built using Tensorflow with the TF.Keras API
- This project scrapes images from google using various taglines. The goal was to collect my own images of some of the main characters (Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo).
- After collecting the images, transfer learning was applied using ImageNet weights to classify each character.
- Using VGG16 architecture, accuracy reached 92% on test set.
